Hi there! 
I see you've been learning a lot about farming and cooking recently.
...
That's great to hear! 
Actually, I have somewhat of a dilemma. 
Our banquet is about to start and we have to be prepared to feed all of our villagers.
Thanks to your help, we'll be able to have a great feast. 
However, it's been a bit hectic, so I haven't had the time to clean up from lunch earlier. 
Do you think you could help me collect the plates around here?
Usually it would be pretty easy, but a pesky monkey snuck in earlier and caused a mess!
...
Oh, you know him too? Yeah, he's infamous for causing trouble around here. 
Please help me collect all of the dishes so we can start the banquet on time!
But don't let that monkey catch you. 
If he knows you're trying to help, he'll cause even more chaos.
...
Thank you so much! Alright, check back in with me once you've collected all the plates then!
