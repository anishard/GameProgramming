Echo asked me to set things up for the banquet...
...
The staff before me didn't clean up after lunch. I'm kinda busy, can you collect the plates from around the hall?
I'd do it myself but I don't wanna deal with the monkey.
Collect all of them.
...
Please.

Check back in when you're done. Don't let him catch you though, he'll cause even more chaos.
