Echo
That's the gist of it. Easy, right? I'm close with Billy so I know the ropes.
I don't have any more seeds on me, but I'm sure you can find some lying around.
When you have time, come visit town! The villagers have been looking forward to your services.
And have our food ready by the end of the week.
...
Every week. See you around!
