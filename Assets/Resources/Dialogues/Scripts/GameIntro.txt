Welcome to Moondrop Dale! I'm Faelyn!
You moved in at the perfect time! "Moon Flavors," our annual festival, is coming up. Every harvest season, the townspeople gather their finest ingredients and whip up a dish, all for the chance to win the title of "Best Chef in Town"!
Say... you'll come to the competition, right?
You might come watch? Don't be silly, you have to participate!
You don't know how to cook?
That's fair...
...
It's great to see the old farm up and running again, you must be real passionate about farming!
...
For real?
...
Should we get started with the basics, then?
