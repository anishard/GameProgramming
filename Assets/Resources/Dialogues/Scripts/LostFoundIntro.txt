Hi, I'm Billy!
It's great to see how you've been learning here at Moondrop Dale!
...
Before we continue with your journey, I was wondering if you could help me out.
I actually lost my spading fork somewhere around here...
Without that, I can't farm at all!
...
Really? Great, thank you so much!
Oh! One more thing.
Just watch out for that pesky monkey! He's such a pickpocket.
...
Alright, I'll leave you to it then!
