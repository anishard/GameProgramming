Hi, I'm Billy!
It's great to see how you've been learning here at Moondrop Dale!
...
Before we continue with your journey, I was wondering if you could help me out.
I actually lost my spading fork somewhere around here. My eyesight seems to be failing haha...
But without it, I can't farm at all!
...
Really? You'd help me out? 
...
Great, thank you so much! I owe you one.
Oh! One more thing.
Just watch out for that pesky monkey! He's such a pickpocket.
...
Alright, I'll leave you to it then!
