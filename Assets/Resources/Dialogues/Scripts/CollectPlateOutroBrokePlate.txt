Great, thank you so much! You've been a great help.
...
Ah, yeah that monkey likes to wreak havoc by breaking plates and whatnot.
Don't worry about it, we have plenty more plates to serve our villagers! 
It looks like we were able to get rid of him though, thank goodness!
Wouldn't want him running around at our banquet...
Here is a little reward for helping me out!
...
See you at the banquet, then!
