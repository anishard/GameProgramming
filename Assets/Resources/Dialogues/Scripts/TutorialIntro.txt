Ah! You must be the new farmer.
Welcome to Moondrop Dale. It's such a relief that you're here. We've been in such a pinch since Billy stepped back.
Huh?
The farmer. Billy. He catered for us. Weren't you gonna replace him?
Are you sure?
...
We're pretty desperate.
...
You can always learn to cook. That's no issue.
...
Farming too. No issue. No biggie.
You'll do it right? Cater for us? We're all kind of really depending on you. It's unfair of you to spring this on us so suddenly, to be honest.

Fantastic! I'll show you around.
